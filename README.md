# sdb

A bash shell function that records bash_history in a sqlite3 database.
Recorded commands can be queried and executed.

----
The following are shown in the query.
```
+-------+--------+---------------------+----------------------+--------+----------------+----------------+
|  ID   | COUNT  |      DATE/TIME      |      USER@HOST       | STATUS |   DIRECTORY    |â–¶   COMMAND     |
+-------+--------+---------------------+----------------------+--------+----------------+----------------+
```

----
### Prerequisites

Bash history time format **MUST** be in epoch.
```
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%s "
```

Only tested on bash version 4+ and the following GNU tools. Most of them are included in the GNU coreutils.

```
sqlite3, mktemp, uname, date, dd, base64, whoami, rm, tput, vim
```

----
### Installing

A preferable place would be some directory that is not in your PATH.
like for example **~/dotfiles.** It can be sourced from **~/.bashrc**

Create the directory and cd into it.
```
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles
```
Clone the repo from github.
```
git clone https://github.com/Jetchisel/sdb
```
Source sdb.
```
source sdb/sdb
```

Put something like this in your **~/.bashrc**.
```
if [[ -f $HOME/dotfiles/sdb/sdb ]]; then
  source "$HOME/dotfiles/sdb/sdb"
fi
```
so during interactive session sdb is sourced.


----
### Example of sdb commands.

Show all 100 commands including the **previous** and **other** shell session.
```
sdb -a
```
Show commands with a **zero exit status**.
```
sdb -z
```

Show only **10** recent commands.
```
sdb -m 10
```

Show the **exit status** and **directory** of the commands.
```
sdb -ld
```

Search for commands that starts with **zypper** and ends with **bash**.
```
sdb -b zypper -e bash
```

Show commands that has been executed **inside** the directory /tmp **and below** it (recursive).
```
sdb -r /tmp
```

Execute the command with the **ID 50**. Commands executed using the **EVAL** builtin command from bash.
```
sdb -E 50
```

Search commands from the **last ten years** and **now**, following the **GNU date** words syntax separated by a comma.
```
sdb -cam+ -t '-10 years, now'
 ```

Try the help option for more info about how to use sdb.
```
sdb --help
```

---
### Multi user
For multi user option ala central database for users some changes needs to be done.

First create a directory where the shared history database will reside as opposed to the default location.
```
mkdir /path/to/new/directory
```

Put the line below in your ~/.bashrc,  if you're sourcing sdb from ~/.bashrc preferably before that line.
```
SDB_DATABASE=/path/to/new/directory/bash_history.sqlite
```
or whatever you want to name that database instead of **bash_history.sqlite**

Users that will use the database **MUST** have **read** and **write** access to the **directory** and the **database**.
Assuming that the default group is being used. (Otherwise create a new group)
```
chmod -Rv g+rw /path/to/new/directory/
 ```

**DO NOT** use the default location of the database for multi user set up!


If you are more adventurous you can add the root user (not recommended but doable).

Try a network share for the database as well :).

----
### Sqlite Commands.
An example of how to query the database assuming the default name and location from the script.
```
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite '.mode column' '.header on' '.width 6 15 7 20 50 50' 'select id,epoch,exit_status as status,TRIM(user_hosts) as user_hosts,pwd,cmd from history DESC limit 20;' | less -Ss
```

An example of how to update/set/edit the epoch time with the ID that has a value of 129.
```
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite "update history set epoch = 1514694219 where id = 129;"
```

An example of how to delete the entry with the ID 7.
```
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite "delete from history where id = 7;"
```

An example of how to **delete** **ALL** commands that matches **sdb** or **'sdb '**

```
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite "delete from history where cmd = 'sdb' or cmd like 'sdb %';"
```

---
### Security

If security is an issue then you are at the wrong place!

This is for recording bash history for a user or a group of trusted users.

If the builtin command **eval** is not for you, just ignore the **-E** option.

but... but... sql injection...

---
### Trouble shooting

* Error where it says something about **could not write to database**

    Check the permission of the **directory** and the database **file**

* The value of the **COMMAND** column is **HISTTIMEFORMAT="%s "**

    Set the time format **exactly** to **HISTTIMEFORMAT="%s "**

* Error where it says database or table is missing.

    Check the database if it is still in place.

    Check if the table has been removed.
