# sdb

A bash shell function that records bash_history in a sqlite3 database.
Recorded commands can be queried and executed.

----
The following are shown in the query.
```
+------------+--------+---------------------+----------------------+--------+---------+----------------+----------------+
|     ID     | COUNT  |      DATE/TIME      |      USER@HOST       | STATUS |   TTY   |   DIRECTORY    |â–¶    COMMAND    |
+------------+--------+---------------------+----------------------+--------+---------+----------------+----------------+
```

----
### Prerequisites

Make sure that access to the command history is **ENABLED**.


First check the output of

```shell
set -o | grep history
```

The output should show **on**

```shell
history         on
```

If it is not then set it to **on** in your **~/.bashrc** file.

```shell
set -o history
```

In some cases you need to put a test if it is enabled already, something like.

```shell
set -o | grep -q '^history[[:space:]]\{1,\}on$' || set -o history                          #
```
or

```shell
if [[ "$(set -o | awk '$1 == "history" {print $2}')" = off ]]; then
  set -o history
fi
```

Bash history time format **MUST** be in **epoch**.
```shell
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%s "
```

Bash version 4+ and the following GNU tools. Most of them are included in the GNU coreutils.

* dd
* rm
* vim
* tput
* date
* uname
* less
* mktemp
* base64
* whoami
* sqlite3
* realpath

----
### Installing

A preferable place would be some directory that is not in your PATH.
like for example **~/dotfiles.** It can be sourced from **~/.bashrc**

Create the directory and cd into it.
```shell
mkdir -p ~/dotfiles && cd ~/dotfiles
```
Clone the repo from github.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Jetchisel/sdb
```
Source sdb.
```shell
source sdb/sdb
```

Put something like this in your **~/.bashrc**.
```shell
if [[ -f $HOME/dotfiles/sdb/sdb ]]; then
  source "$HOME/dotfiles/sdb/sdb"
fi
```
so during interactive session sdb is sourced.

----
### How does it work

Everything is in the past tense, except for the exit command which is a function
Because the commands has already been executed. The output of **history** is being
parsed, **history 2** to be more exact/precise. **history 1** for most of the
commands and **history 2** for some commands.

Commands such as **exec bash** or **source ~/.bashrc** and the likes cannot be
captured with just **history 1** because all of the shellrc files is being
re-read/sourced just like opening a new terminal/shell.

With the limited info that is being shown in the **history 2** command, there is
not much to go on, so we  resort to some work arounds  and hacks to gather the
most accurate data as much as possible just to fill in some info in the sqlite3
tables (history and directories).

----
### Example of sdb commands.

Show all 100 commands including the **previous** and **other** shell session.
```shell
sdb -a
```
Show commands with a **zero exit status**.
```shell
sdb -n 0
```

Show only **10** recent commands.
```shell
sdb -m 10
```

Show the **exit status** and **directory** of the commands.
```shell
sdb -ld
```

Search for commands that starts with **zypper** and ends with **bash**.
```shell
sdb -b zypper -e bash
```

Show commands that has been executed **inside** the directory /tmp **and below** it (recursive).
```shell
sdb -r /tmp
```

Execute the command with the **ID 50**. Commands executed using the **EVAL** builtin command from bash.
```shell
sdb -E 50
```

Search commands from the **last ten years** and **now**, following the **GNU date** words syntax separated by a comma.
```shell
sdb -cam+ -t '-10 years, now'
 ```

Try the help option for more info about how to use sdb.
```shell
sdb --help
```

---
### Multi user
For multi user option ala central database for users some changes needs to be done.

First create a directory where the shared history database will reside as opposed to the default location.
```shell
mkdir /path/to/new/directory
```

Put the line below in your ~/.bashrc,  if you're sourcing sdb from ~/.bashrc preferably before that line.
```shell
SDB_DATABASE=/path/to/new/directory/bash_history.sqlite
```
or whatever you want to name that database instead of **bash_history.sqlite**

Users that will use the database **MUST** have **read** and **write** access to the **directory** and the **database**.
Assuming that the default group is being used. (Otherwise create a new group)
```shell
chmod -Rv g+rw /path/to/new/directory/
 ```

**DO NOT** use the default location of the database for multi user set up!

If you are more adventurous you can add the root user (not recommended but doable).

Try a network share for the database as well :).

----
### Sqlite Commands.
An example of how to query the database assuming the default name and location from the script.
```shell
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite '.mode column' '.header on' '.width 6 15 7 9 20 50 50' 'select id,epoch,exit_status as status,tty,user_hosts,pwd,cmd from history DESC limit 20;' | less -Ss
```

An example of how to update/set/edit the epoch time with the ID that has a value of 129.
```shell
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite "update history set epoch = 1514694219 where id = 129;"
```

An example of how to delete the entry with the ID 7.
```shell
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite "delete from history where id = 7;"
```

An example of how to **delete** **ALL** commands that matches **sdb** or **'sdb '**

```shell
sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite "delete from history where cmd = 'sdb' or cmd like 'sdb %';"
```

---
### Security

If security is an issue then you are at the wrong place!

This is for recording bash history for a user or a group of trusted users.

If the builtin command **eval** is not for you, just ignore the **-E** option, choice number **1** and **4**.

but... but... sql injection...

well to its defense see what google has to say about sqlite.

```
SQL is query language. Sqlite is embeddable relational database management system. Unlike other databases
(like SQL Server and MySQL) SQLite does not support stored procedures. SQLite is file-based, unlike other
databases, like SQL Server and MySQL which are server-based.
```

#### Is sqlite secure?
```
SQLite database is used for storing data on mobile devices. It's important to secure your data to avoid
rooting and jailbreaking. SQLite database has become the first choice for storing data on mobile devices.
SQLite databases are just files that are stored on the file system.
```

To sum it up, sqlite does not do a server and client mode. It does not need a granting of permissions or
authentications. It is file based, so if only you and or a group of trusted users will use/share the data
base then that should be free from all of that injection thing since that happens on a server that is open
for access to the public, meaning any one or thing that has a browser and/or has access to the internet can
view/reach your servers then that is where the problem starts. Still don't take my word for it, read what the
license file has to say.

### Trouble shooting

Error where it says something about **could not write to database**

  *  Check the permission of the **directory** and the database **file**

The value of the **COMMAND** column is **HISTTIMEFORMAT="%s "**

  *  Set the time format **literally** to **HISTTIMEFORMAT="%s "** in your **~/.bashrc** file

Error where it says database or table is missing.

  *  Check the database if it is still in place.

  *  Check if the table has been removed.

  *  A quick fix is to rename the database to something else and run **exec bash**

The command **exit** does not exit the current shell session.

  *  Invoke the builtin by:  **builtin exit**

  *  Set the time format **literally** to **HISTTIMEFORMAT="%s "** in your **~/.bashrc** file

The exit_status column  value is **777**

  *  Check if the first value of **"$PROMPT_COMMAND"** is still **__sdb_prompt**

  *  Check for the string **Last_Command** in the sdb script.  It should be just below the
     line where the **__sdb_prompt** function is.

To fix the column  Replace the 777 exit status with something else. (Assuming the default location of the database)

```
  sqlite3 ~/.bash_history.sqlite "UPDATE history SET exit_status = 'something' where id = 'anotherthing';"
```

Change the value of **something** which is the **777** and **anotherthing** which is the **ID** or the first column into a digit.

----
### Miscellaneous

Add a new function that can navigate through the previous directories by parsing the directories table created by sdb.
